            Driven by my natural curiosity and passion for computer science, I
            would still do this job even if I dont need to get paid anymore. I
            am a self-taught Frontend Software Developer. I juggle the surface
            of the internet to find the artist in me, coding is the only way I
            can define Art and understand it. It gets easier because am a keen
            learner. For me learning is like 'chasing a high' and guess what..
            you never learn enough in this field and that's why I know I will
            always be here dabbling in software Design, Development and
            Security.

                I combine most of the great tools listed above and use them in
                web/apps development from scratch. One of the most importunate
                things about software development is keeping up to date with
                trending technologies. Nevertheless, theyâ€™re needed for
                developing better, secured and advanced softwares.

                UI or UX designing is another whole profession itself, but it's
                one a programmer is likely to acquire on a basic level. It is
                needed to make our job easier when coding. Since great software
                has a lot to do with its feels, user interaction, and
                experience.

                Building software from ground up is challenging, maintaining
                software build by others is tougher and more challenging. This
                is why a good quality of a programmer is to be able to read
                other people's code, refactor them and rewrite them with the
                latest technology tools for safety and speed. Maintaining a
                scalable software defines a programmer.
